## Local dev setup

- Add `127.0.0.1   keycloak` and `127.0.0.1   proxy` to your `/etc/hosts`. this is necessary for the keycloak redirection
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Login to keycloak at `http://keycloak:8080` as `admin/admin` and create a new user in the `app-realm` realm, and check its "verified email" status.
- Now try to login with your new user via http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Tips

- To signout from the target app, call `/oauth2/sign_out`
